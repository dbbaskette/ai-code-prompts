# Machine Learning Pipeline Prompt

## Purpose
Assist with machine learning pipelines.

## Rules
1. Separate stages: ingestion → preprocessing → training → evaluation → deployment.
2. Use pipelines (e.g., sklearn Pipeline) and config-driven parameters.
3. Track experiments (e.g., MLflow) and ensure reproducibility (random seeds).
4. Provide metrics and a short model card when delivering models.

## Libraries
- scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- MLflow for tracking
- Optional: PyTorch/TF when needed
